# GENDER DETECTION AND AGE DETECTION.

The data science assignment focuses on developing robust models for predicting gender and age from facial images using a Kaggle dataset. Interns will go through the following steps:

Data Preprocessing:

Extract facial features from the dataset.

Prepare the data for machine learning tasks.

Model Selection:

Explore machine learning techniques such as deep learning and computer vision algorithms.

Specifically, investigate convolutional neural networks (CNNs), facial landmark detection, and age regression models.

Model Development:

Develop models that can accurately predict gender and estimate age from facial images.

Utilize deep learning techniques to train these models on the prepared dataset.

Model Evaluation:

Perform model training, validation, and testing to ensure accuracy and robustness.

Fine-tune models as necessary to achieve better predictions.

Practical Experience:

Gain hands-on experience in image classification and age estimation using real-world data.

Apply data science and machine learning concepts to solve a real-world problem.
